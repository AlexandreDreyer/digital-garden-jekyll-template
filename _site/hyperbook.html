            <p>As my manuscript grew, so did my frustration. The topic of uncertainty spans domains as far and wide as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, philosophy, particle physics, art, design, economics, and constitutional law. It became more and more difficult to weave a linear narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Therefore, in the spring of 2022 I decided to change my writing method. In order to reflect the fractal nature of this subject, I began to write in short paragraphs. These are small snippets of text that are self-contained, but semantically connected with others by topic or domain. Together, this assemblage of hundreds of paragraphs forms a knowledge graph - a fractal, semantically linked cloud of written elements. This is nothing new. The internet as a whole is a giant such knowledge  graph, and many people maintain their personal and professional research inside such <strong><em>digital gardens</em></strong> for others to explore. However, the navigation through these digital gardens is cumbersome because readers have to follow hyperlinks or browse the table on contents. Ultimately, one often gets lost. Therefore, to ensure a simple and enjoyable reading experience, I have curated paths through this cloud of writing. Each short page has a forward and back button, but also leaves the option of freely navigating the hypergraph. I hope that this experiment leads to a more engaging experience, empowering readers to explore the topic of uncertainty on their own terms.</p>
