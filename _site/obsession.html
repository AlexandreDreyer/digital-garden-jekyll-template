            <p>During my two decades of creative toil, I made a puzzling discovery. I experienced first hand that creative professionals as disparate as script writers, composers, sculptors, user experience designers, and photographers all share a curious personality trait I could not find in others. They have an elevated tolerance for ambiguity and openness to new experiences. Whether consciously or unconsciously they have internalized that generating something original is necessarily the exploration of the hitherto unknown. The mapping of unpredictable terrain. In the pursuit of novel solutions they have learned (among many other things) to treat uncertainty as a familiar friend, domesticate it, and actively seek out the unknown. However, I realized that the creative space is limited, and so I started interviewing scientists, corporate strategists, economists, investors, architects, and educators about uncertainty. All responses were very much alike. Everyone acknowledged that uncertainty played a significant role in their life and work, but struggled to define or explain how to deal with it. In my interviews, uncertainty appeared like a dim, murky space that defied attempts to describe it. <strong><em>And thus my obsession was born</em></strong>. I spent the following years interviewing more people and reading every book, article, research paper and blog related to uncertainty I could get my hands on. I scrutinized uncertainty like a bug in a jar, formulated frameworks, and explored the areas of academia and business where it plays a defining role. This is the account of this ongoing pursuit. The captainâ€™s log of my journey, navigating the seas of uncertainty.</p>
