            <p>Uncertainty is a formidable beast. It profoundly shapes our lives, yet playfully eludes our grasp. Frightful yet fleeting, majestic yet transient, it lurks in the shadows averting our attention. What is this daunting creature and how do we tame it? Finding answers to this question is hard, and as I found out, writing about it is even harder. Uncertainty is intangible by nature, has many dimensions, and affects us on multiple planes, from the abstract down to the cellular. Adding a pickle to this predicament, our complex relationship with uncertainty even strains the semiotic boundaries of language. Just like the English word <em>love</em> utterly fails to discriminate between the different emotions between a mother and her child, passionate lovers, soldiers on the battlefield, or couples after decades of partnership. Language struggles to properly capture its multifaceted nature. That is because the concept of uncertainty is fuzzy by nature, and this ambiguity is reflected in the English language.</p>
