            <p>All life partakes in this continuous dance. A feedback loop with its extended environment. Through this recursive interaction, life and its environment modify each other, leading to organisms encoding features of the world within themselves. These features are patterns of <strong>order</strong> extracted from a vast ocean of <strong>randomness</strong>. We usually call these patterns by a different name: causal inferences. These inferences are used as raw material for manufacturing <strong>predictions</strong> - a commodity that most organisms rely on for survival. Life relies on predictions to make <strong>choices</strong>. Whether conscious or unconscious, intentional or reflexive, both action and inaction require choice. Life, prediction, and choice are inextricably coiled up together in a network of roots that is of paramount importance for this book. That is because where there is life, there is prediction. Where there is prediction, there is choice. And where there is choice, there is uncertainty.</p>
