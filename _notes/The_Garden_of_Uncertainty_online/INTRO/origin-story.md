title: Origin Story
---
As an industrial designer, I had originally intended to write a book about a subject matter close to my heart. ***Creativity***. As a designer, creative director, and entrepreneur I have spent the last twenty years learning the craft of upholstery in Italy, designing teak furniture on the island of Java,  prototyping bunkbeds in India, building wheelchairs in Korea, and developing LED lights in China. I have designed and built retail stores for French luxury brands, helped 3D print concept cars, and ran corporate innovation programs. But somewhere along the way, as so often in my life, something unexpected happened. I became fascinated with the connection between creativity and uncertainty. I discovered that creative professionals as disparate as script writers, composers, sculptors, user experience designers, and photographers all share a curious personality trait. They have an elevated tolerance for ambiguity and openness to new experiences. Whether consciously or unconsciously they have internalized that generating something original is necessarily the exploration of hitherto unknown connections and the mapping of unpredictable terrain. In the pursuit of novel solutions they have learned (among many other things) to treat uncertainty as a familiar friend, domesticate it, and actively seek out the unknown. However, I realized that the creative space is a very limited area, and so I decided to expand my horizon. I was curious to learn how uncertainty was dealt with in other professions, so I started interviewing scientists, corporate strategists, economists, investors, architects and educators. All responses were very much alike. Everyone acknowledged that uncertainty played a significant role in their life, but struggled to define or explain how they dealt with it. In my interviews uncertainty appeared like a dim, murky space that defied attempts to describe it. ***And thus my obsession was born***. I spent the following years interviewing more people and reading every book, article, research paper and blog related to uncertainty I could get my hands on. I scrutinized uncertainty like a bug in a jar, formulated frameworks, and explored the areas of academia and business where it plays a defining role.
