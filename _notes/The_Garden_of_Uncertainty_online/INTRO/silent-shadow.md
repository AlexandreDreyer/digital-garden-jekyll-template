title: Silent Shadow
---
Like a silent shadow, uncertainty lurks in the cracks between hope and expectation, doubt and possibility. As herald of the unknown, we shun it like a dark omen, harbinger of peril. That is because the first and deepest root cause of uncertainty is the encounter with a most formidable enemy. Our death. In the desolate place of this encounter, dread and terror make us long for defined spaces, predictable outcomes, and all things permanent and unmoving. It is here that our yearning for **_certainty_** is born. Crucially, this sentiment is not limited to the mortality of our bodies. It encompasses the _little death_, the irreversibility of time. The transformation of each moment of the present into an immutable past. The relentless collapse of unfolding potential into historical actuality.
