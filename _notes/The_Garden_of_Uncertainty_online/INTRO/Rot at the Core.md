---
All is not well in paradise. In the wealthiest pockets of this paradigm of profit and prosperity, there is rot at the core. Many are afflicted with anxiety disorders, feelings of general _malaise_, or a deep weariness that things are getting worse. The ghost of uncertainty is haunting the dreary mansion of human civilization. Cases of depression and suicide are on the rise, and so are instances of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Substance addiction is steadily increasing. Loneliness afflicts legions of city dwellers, driving a virtual exodus into a digital meta-verse.
