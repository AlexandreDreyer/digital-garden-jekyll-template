title: Shoshana Zuboff quote
---
>“Social trust is highly correlated with peaceful collective decision making and civic engagement. In its absence, the authority of shared values and mutual obligations slips away. The void that remains is a loud signal of societal vulnerability. Confusion, uncertainty, and distrust enable power to fill the social void"

~ Zuboff, Shoshana. The age of surveillance capitalism : the fight for a human future at the new frontier of power. London: Profile Books, 2019. Print.
