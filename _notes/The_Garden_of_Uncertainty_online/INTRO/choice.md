title: Choice

Choice is part of every survival strategy. Insects choose what is safe to eat, plants when to blossom, and bacteria where to swim to find nutrients. From this perspective, human decision-making is only marginally more sophisticated than that of E-Coli. Choice is made by using a PDA loop, short for *perceive*, *decide*, and *act*. These are mostly patterns embedded via evolutionary pathways. No brain required. Just the sensing of the environment, comparing it with stored if-then patterns, and triggering action accordingly. The organism encodes causal patterns "observed" over evolutionary time spans and attempts to predict the future. It is the extraction of coarse-grained order from an ocean of randomness for the purpose of making accurate forecasts. It is here that we find the ***evolutionary root*** of uncertainty. This is because predictions can be, and often are, wrong. Life's ability to encode accurate chains of causality for the purpose of making predictions decides between life and death. When making decisions, whether you are a CEO or a dung beetle, uncertainty abounds.
