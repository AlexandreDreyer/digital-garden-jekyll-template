title: Hyperbook
---
As my manuscript grew, so did my frustration. The topic of uncertainty spans domains as far and wide as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, philosophy, particle physics, art, design, and constitutional law. It became more and more difficult to weave a linear narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Therefore, in the spring of 2022 I decided to reflect the fractal nature of this subject matter by writing in aphorisms. Smaller snippets that are semantically connected inside a knowledge graph. For this purpose, I started using Obsidian as a markdown writing tool, and published my writing using a combination of GitHub, Jekyll, and Netlify. That means that the entire book is available online home here, with multiple curated pathways through it, as well as the option of freely navigating the hypergraph. I hope that this experiment leads to a more engaging experience, empowering readers to explore the topic of uncertainty on their own terms. Together with the readers contributing their own thoughts and artwork, I wish to achieve a collaborative body of work that embodies the creative freedom that is the promise of domesticating uncertainty.
