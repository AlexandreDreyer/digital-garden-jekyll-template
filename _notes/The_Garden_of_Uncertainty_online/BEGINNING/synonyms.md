title: Synonyms
---
The language around uncertainty is vague, and many words are used interchangeably with it. Here is a list of synonyms for “uncertain” that I have assembled from various dictionaries:

>Indeterminate, dubious, unknown, vague, ambiguous, indefinite, obscure, unpredictable, capricious, changeable, fickle, fluctuating, fluid, inconsistent, mercurial, skittish, temperamental, unsettled, unstable, unsteady, variable, volatile.

Although it seems confusing, this list reveals an interesting pattern. The first seven terms are concerned with ***quality of information***. They describe a lack of clarity or trust in knowledge. The eighth word, “unpredictable”, stands alone as a statement about our (in)ability to make ***forecasts***. All remaining terms are just variations on the same theme: ***dynamic change***. Herein lies the first clue: These are not synonyms at all. They are ***causes*** of uncertainty. The causes are threefold: _knowledge_, _prediction_, and _change_. Or to put it differently, our inability to know, our failure to predict, and our struggle to deal with change.
