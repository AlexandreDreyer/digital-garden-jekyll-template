>"You are uncertain, to varying degrees, about everything in the future; much of the past is hidden from you; and there is a lot of the present about which you do not have full information. Uncertainty is everywhere and you cannot escape from it."

~ Lindley, D. V. (2006). Understanding Uncertainty. Germany: Wiley.
