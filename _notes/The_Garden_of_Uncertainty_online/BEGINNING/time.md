title: Time
---
With the possible exception of deductive inference (pure logic), our choices are an interaction with the dimension of ***time***. Observations in the ***past*** are used to choose actions in the ***present*** in order to affect a favorable ***future***. This dynamic dalliance with time is another primary root of uncertainty. Our knowledge of the past is dubious, our choices in the present capricious and fickle, our predictions of the future unreliable at best. This entanglement with time is important because it affects our beliefs about the past, our actions in the present, and our expectations about the future. All of these are imperfect, dynamic, volatile, and ever uncertain. As they should be. And so it is worth looking at this interaction with some care and attention. This is what this section is about.
