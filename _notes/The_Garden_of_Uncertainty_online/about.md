title: About
---
This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of ***uncertainty***, and a practical experiment with the medium we call ***book***. I publish this work-in-progress to share my exploration of this wide topic. But also to solicit feedback from fellow navigators of uncertainty. Once completed, a print version will be published, while this digital garden will remain online. Please drop a comment, poem, drawing, or image on a page you like. These are ***marginalia*** in reference to the age-old custom of scribbling in the margins of books. When this book goes to print, select marginalia will be included in the print-run. Authors will be credited by name and receive a ***free print book***.

***How to read this book***
