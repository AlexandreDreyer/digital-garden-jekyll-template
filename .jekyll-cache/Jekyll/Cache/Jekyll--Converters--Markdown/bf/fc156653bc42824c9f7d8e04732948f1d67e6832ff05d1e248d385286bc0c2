I"æ<p>This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of <strong><em>uncertainty</em></strong>, and a practical experiment with the medium we call <strong><em>book</em></strong>. I publish this work-in-progress to share my exploration of this wide topic. But also to solicit feedback from fellow navigators of uncertainty. Once completed, a print version will be published, while this digital garden will remain online.</p>
