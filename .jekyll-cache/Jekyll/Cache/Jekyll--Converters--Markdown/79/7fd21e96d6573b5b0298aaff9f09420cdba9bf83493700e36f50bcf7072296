I"£<p>For the first time in history, the structural organization of human society has been fundamentally altered. Historical societies had a <em>linear</em> structural organization. That means direct control was exerted through hierarchy, central coordination, and the top-down flow of power. Said power used to be organized around the ability to <em>control</em> and <em>predict</em>. The halo of authority rested on the promise that the future could be ordained. Therefore, authority required a predictable environment. The local environment had to be uniform, probabilistic (gaussian), stable, and somewhat intuitive. All this came to an abrupt end within the mesh. Inside this interconnected structure, linear organizations are challenged by distributed networks. Groups self-organize into de-centralized, collective, bottom-up formations. Connectivity causes unpredictable behavior of power law and scale-free distributions, fat tails, and dynamic change. Fragile states, unintuitive and fleeting. This new environment is central authorityâ€™s worst nightmare. Zero-sum competitive arms races are making way for unpredictable fitness landscapes. The control of closed, protected know-how is being challenged by swarm intelligence. Production efficiency increasingly replaced by creativity and imagination.</p>
