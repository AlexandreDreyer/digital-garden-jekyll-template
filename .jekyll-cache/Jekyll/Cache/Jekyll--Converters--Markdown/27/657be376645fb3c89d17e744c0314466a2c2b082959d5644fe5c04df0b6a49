I"˜<p>Our use of the word uncertain is vague, also because of the many words that are used interchangeably with â€œuncertainâ€. Here is a list of synonyms I have assembled from various dictionaries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeterminate, dubious, unknown, vague, ambiguous, indefinite, obscure, unpredictable, capricious, changeable, fickle, fluctuating, fluid, inconsistent, mercurial, skittish, temperamental, unsettled, unstable, unsteady, variable, volatile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This list seems daunting at first, but a closer look reveals an interesting pattern. It appears that these synonyms fall into neat categories: The first seven are concerned with quality of information. They describe a lack of clarity or trust in the knowledge derived from something. The eighth word, â€œunpredictableâ€, stands alone as a statement about our (in)ability to make forecasts. Whereas all remaining terms are just variations of the same theme: dynamic change. Here, the English language offers us the first clue about the roots of uncertainty. These are not synonyms at all. They are <em>causes</em> of uncertainty. The causes are threefold: <em>knowledge</em>, <em>prediction</em>, and <em>change</em>. Or to put it differently, by our inability to know, our failure to predict, and our struggle to deal with change.</p>
