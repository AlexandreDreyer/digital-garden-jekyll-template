I"Þ<p>There are those who see the past as a golden age of glory. A time in which founders and heroes shaped our very identity in their wise, prophetic hands. Others see the past as crude habitat of our primitive forebears. Savages living archaic lives that were nasty, brutish, and short. Both of these views are fundamentally wrong, but not for the apparent reasons. They are wrong because both view the past as a settled historical fact. Something static and fixed in place.</p>
