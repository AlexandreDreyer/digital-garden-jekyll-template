I"K<p>At long last, after <a class="internal-link" href="/darwin">microbes</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/skinner">mice</a>, and <a class="internal-link" href="/popper">mammals</a>, we have finally arrived at our destination. Man. Dennett calls them <strong>Gregorian creatures</strong> in honor of Richard Gregory: “the psychologist who emphasized the role of thinking tools in providing thinkers with what he called “potential intelligence.” The Gregorian creature’s Umwelt is well stocked with thinking tools, both abstract and concrete: arithmetic and democracy and double-blind studies, and microscopes, maps and computers.” Humans are the only creatures to use these advanced thinking tools. They further enhance our ability to extract ever more predictive patterns from randomness. Not only can we build a virtual model of the world, but we can use that environment to infer rules about the real world. Our thinking tools help us understand the structure of the universe, particle physics, quantum entanglement, as well as that men are from Mars, and women from Venus.</p>
