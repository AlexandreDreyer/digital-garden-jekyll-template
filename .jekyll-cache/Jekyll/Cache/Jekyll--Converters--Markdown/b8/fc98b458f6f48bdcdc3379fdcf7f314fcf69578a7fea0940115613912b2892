I"ý<p>There are those who see the past as a golden age of glory. A time in which founders and heroes shaped our very identity in their wise, prophetic hands. Others see the past as crude habitat of our primitive forebears. Savages living archaic lives that were nasty, brutish, and short. Both of these views are fundamentally wrong, but not for the apparent reasons. They are wrong because both view the past as a settled historical fact. Something static and fixed in place.</p>

<p>This is a misunderstanding, because our choices are not based on rigid facts. They are based on the <strong><em>beliefs</em></strong> we hold about them. Arbitrary and biased beliefs we constructed from partial and fragmented knowledge of the past. When we look at scattered blotches of ink on a vast sheet of paper, the image we perceive is not an objective fact. It is the Rorschach projection of ourself onto the paper. This is crucial because our value system, identity, and decision-making are all based on these <strong><em>interpretations</em></strong> of the past. Interpretations fraught with uncertainty. If you have ever experienced or learned something new that utterly re-shaped your understanding of the past, then you know how acutely profound this can feel in the present. It can be a simple aha-moment or a life-changing realization that can break down your very sense of existence. The past is not a monolithic mass, frozen in time. It is an endlessly changing space full of surprises, obscuring and revealing, infinitely creating possibilities. To master the art of uncertainty, we need to open ourselves to this fitful yet fertile dance with the dynamic past. For it holds the key to our future.</p>
