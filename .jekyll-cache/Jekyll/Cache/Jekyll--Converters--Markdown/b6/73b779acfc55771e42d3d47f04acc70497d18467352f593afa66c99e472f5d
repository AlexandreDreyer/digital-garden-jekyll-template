I"v<p>The language around uncertainty is vague, and many words are used interchangeably with it. Here is a list of synonyms for “uncertain” that I have assembled from various dictionaries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeterminate, dubious, unknown, vague, ambiguous, indefinite, obscure, unpredictable, capricious, changeable, fickle, fluctuating, fluid, inconsistent, mercurial, skittish, temperamental, unsettled, unstable, unsteady, variable, volatile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it seems confusing, this list reveals an interesting pattern. The first seven terms are concerned with <strong><em>quality of information</em></strong>. They describe a lack of clarity or trust in the knowledge derived from something. The eighth word, “unpredictable”, stands alone as a statement about our (in)ability to make <strong><em>forecasts</em></strong>. Whereas all remaining terms are just variations of the same theme: <strong><em>dynamic change</em></strong>. Herein lies the first clue: These are not synonyms at all. They are <strong><em>causes</em></strong> of uncertainty. The causes are threefold: <em>knowledge</em>, <em>prediction</em>, and <em>change</em>. Or to put it differently, by our inability to know, our failure to predict, and our struggle to deal with change.</p>
