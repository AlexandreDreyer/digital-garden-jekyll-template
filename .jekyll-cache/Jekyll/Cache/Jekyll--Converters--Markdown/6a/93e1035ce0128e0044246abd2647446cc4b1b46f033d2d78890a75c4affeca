I"ä	<p>Some view the past as bathed in the golden glow of timeless glory. A time in which founders and heroes shaped our identity with prophetic hands. Others see the past as crude habitat of our primitive forebears. Savages living archaic lives that were nasty, brutish, and short. Both of these views are equally absurd, but perhaps not for the reasons most apparent to us. For one, they do not stand up to scrutiny by historians and archeologists. But also, these views make a false assumption that is all too common. They view the past as a settled historical fact. Something fixed and static. Frozen objects, gradually receding in the rearview mirror, driven by the unrelenting forward motion of time. But past events are not distant monoliths of questionable relevance. They are the raw material from which we manufacture a precious commodity. Prediction and choice. The past is a malleable material because our choices are based on the <strong><em>beliefs</em></strong> we hold about it. Beliefs shaped from partial knowledge, cognitive biases, and arbitrary interpretations. Like looking at random blotches of ink on a paper, the image we perceive is not a historical fact. It is the Rorschach projection of ourselves onto a canvas. Our value system, identity, and decision-making are all based on these <strong><em>interpretations</em></strong> of the past. Interpretations fraught with uncertainty. If you have ever experienced or learned something new that utterly re-shaped your understanding of the past, then you know how acutely profound this feels. It can be a simple aha-moment, or a life-changing realization threatening your very sense of existence. The past is not a monolithic mass, frozen in time. It is an endlessly changing space full of surprises, obscuring and revealing, pregnant with possibility. To master the art of uncertainty, we need to remain open to re-interpreting bygones, for they have not truly gone-by. Every new discovery can change our understanding the past, and therefore, of ourselves in the present. Whether we like it or not, we ought to participate in this fitful yet fertile dance with the dynamic past. For it holds the key to our future.</p>
