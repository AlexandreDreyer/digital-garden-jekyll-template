  <p>THIS book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of <strong><em>uncertainty</em></strong>, and a practical experiment with the medium we call “<strong><em>book</em></strong>”.</p>

<h1 id="origin-story">Origin Story</h1>

<p>I am an industrial designer by training and originally intended to write about a subject matter close to my heart. Creativity. As a designer, creative director, and entrepreneur I have spent the last twenty years learning the craft of upholstery in Italy, designing teak furniture on the island of Java,  prototyping bunkbeds in India, building wheelchairs in Korea, and developing LED lights in China. I have designed and built retail stores for French luxury brands, helped 3D print concept cars, and ran corporate innovation programs. But somewhere along the way, as so often in my life, something unexpected happened. I became fascinated with the connection between creativity and uncertainty. I discovered that creative professionals as disparate as script writers, composers, sculptors, user experience designers, and photographers all share a curious personality trait. They have an elevated tolerance for ambiguity and openness to new experiences. Whether consciously or unconsciously they have internalized that generating something original is necessarily the exploration of hitherto unknown connections and the mapping of unpredictable terrain. In the pursuit of novel solutions they have learned (among many other things) to treat uncertainty as a familiar friend, domesticate it, and actively seek out the unknown. However, I realized that the creative space is a very limited area, and so I decided to expand my horizon. I was curious to learn how uncertainty was dealt with in other professions, so I started interviewing scientists, corporate strategists, economists, investors, architects and educators. All responses were very much alike. Everyone acknowledged that uncertainty played a significant role in their life, but struggled to define or explain how they dealt with it. In my interviews uncertainty appeared like a dim, murky space that defied attempts to describe it. <strong>And thus my obsession was born</strong>. I spent the following years interviewing more people and reading every book, article, research paper and blog related to uncertainty I could get my hands on. I scrutinized uncertainty like a bug in a jar, formulated frameworks, and explored the areas of academia and business where it plays a defining role.</p>

<h1 id="on-uncertainty">On Uncertainty</h1>

<p>This book is an attempt to reframe our relationship with this misunderstood feature of our world. My thesis is that uncertainty isn’t a residual error that thwarts our otherwise flawless calculations. It isn’t the small and remote pocket of unexplored wilderness, the diminishing shadow receding before our growing scientific and technological prowess. It is a permanent feature of the world that we neglect at our own peril. It is the vast negative space that delineates our body of knowledge. It is the boundary condition that shapes the evolution of biological life as well as the confines of our perception. It is a force that determines our choices and social interactions. Most importantly, it is the seedbed of creativity, innovation and everything that lies in our future. Uncertainty is value free. Despite common misconceptions it is neither good nor bad. It can help or hinder, spurn or stymie us. However, it has a powerful impact on our lives. It has a direct effect on professional choices and corporate decision-making. As a precursor to fear, it can send shockwaves through global markets, sway government policy, and even trigger war. Lastly, the feeling of uncertainty is often caused by a feature that is becoming a defining characteristic of our time. Change. On a cognitive and emotional level we do not deal well with rapid shifts in our environment. It makes acquired knowledge obsolete and disrupts our habits. However, whether we like it or not, the pace of social, environmental, and technological change is accelerating in the world and it is crucial that we learn to become more adaptable. Understanding, domesticating, and learning to live with uncertainty may well be key to our success as a species.</p>
