I"U<blockquote>
  <p>“From afar shines your own height in golden light across the sea. Like the moon arising from the tides. And you become aware of yourself from afar. And the longing grips you and the will to move yourself. You want to go from Being to Becoming because you understood the breathing and flowing of the sea - leading you here and there without attaching you anywhere. And your wave flings you onto foreign shores - swallows you up and gurgles you down. You saw that it was the life of the whole and the death of each one. Then you felt embraced by general death, by death in the deepest place on earth. Of death in your own strangely breathing and flowing depths. Oh how you long and despair, mortal fear grips you in all this death - breathing slow, eternal flow of coming and going. All these light and dark, warm and tepid and cold waters. All those wavy, swaying, swinging plant-animals and animal-plants. All these nocturnal wonders fill you with dread and you long for the sun, for clear, dry air, for solid stone, for defined space and straight line, for the unmoved and held fast, for rules and a stated purpose, for being alone and your own intention.”</p>
