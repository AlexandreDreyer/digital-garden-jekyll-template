I"å<p>This is not a book. This is an accident, only partially frozen in time. A fluke, growing and evolving. A living assemblage of words, algorithms, images, hyperlinks, and sounds that interact, mature, adapt, yet are never final. It is the developing diary of my continuous exploration of <strong><em>Uncertainty</em></strong>. However, to tell its origin story, I ought to start at the beginning: 
As a product designer by training, I had intended to write a book about a subject close to my heart. <strong><em>Creativity</em></strong>. This is dear to me, because I have spent the last twenty years creating products. I have learned the craft of upholstery in Italy, designed teak furniture on the island of Java, prototyped bunkbeds in India, built wheelchairs in Korea, and developed LED lights in China. I have designed and built retail stores for French luxury brands, helped 3D print concept cars, and ran corporate innovation programs. But this neat list obscures the erratic nature of this path. Much of my creative work has been revised, dismissed, or denied. Clients have openly mocked my inexperience, walked out on me during meetings, and, on one occasion, fired me over dinner. My path has been convoluted and erratic, fit and start, pain as well as gain, more failure than fame. But somewhere along the way, something unexpected happened. I started seeing a connection between creativity and uncertainty. It was nothing but an intuition. A vague feeling I wanted to explore - and so I did.</p>
