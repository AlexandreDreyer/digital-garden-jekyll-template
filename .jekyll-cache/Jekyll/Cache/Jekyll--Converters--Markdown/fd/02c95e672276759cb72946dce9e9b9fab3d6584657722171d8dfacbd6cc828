I"3<p>Like a silent shadow, uncertainty lurks in the cracks between hope and expectation, doubt and possibility. As herald of the unknown, we shun it like a dark omen, harbinger of peril. At the root, our gloomy relationship with uncertainty is the encounter with a most formidable enemy. At the crossroads of our will to <em>become</em> and the encounter with the deepest place on earth. Our death. In this desolate place, dread and terror make us long for defined spaces, predictable outcomes, and all things permanent and unmoving. It is here that our yearning for <strong><em>certainty</em></strong> is born. Crucially, this sentiment is not limited to the mortality of our bodies. It encompasses the <em>little death</em>, the irreversibility of time. The transformation of each moment of the present into an immutable past. The relentless collapse of unfolding potential into historical actuality. In this light, uncertainty is pervasive and all-permeating.</p>
