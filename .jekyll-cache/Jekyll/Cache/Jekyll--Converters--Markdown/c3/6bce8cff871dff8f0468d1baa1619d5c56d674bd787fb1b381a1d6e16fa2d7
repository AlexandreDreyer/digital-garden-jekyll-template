<hr />

<p>Take a stroll through the <strong><em>digital garden of uncertainty</em></strong>. Roam on the curated path and smell the lilies, or wander off into the shadows where the dark roses bloom. But be careful not to stray into the jungle, where creatures howl in the nightâ€¦</p>

<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of <strong><em>uncertainty</em></strong>, and a practical experiment with the medium we call <strong><em>book</em></strong>. I publish this work-in-progress to sollicit feedback from fellow navigators of uncertainty. Once completed, a print version will be published, while this digital garden will remain online.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-read">How to read</h1>
<p>This book has no chapters. It is an assemblage of self-contained paragraphs - each page only a few hunded words long. They are semantically connected, so you can navigate a curated path using the <strong><em>next</em></strong> and <strong><em>back</em></strong> buttons at the bottom of each page. This assemblage has a fractal network structure with five main branches: <a class="internal-link" href="/origin-story">Introduction</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/knowledge">Knowledge</a>, <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  agency|Agency  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  creativity|Creativity  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, and <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  understanding|Uncerstanding  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. Explore them in any order you like, or use the <strong><em>hypergraph</em></strong> button to view and navigate the entire structure.</p>
