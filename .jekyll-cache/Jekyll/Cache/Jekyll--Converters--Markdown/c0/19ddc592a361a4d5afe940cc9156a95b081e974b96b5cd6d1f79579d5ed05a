I"Ô<p>A meandering microbe is nothing short of astonishing. Within a microscopic body, it contains a hereditary blueprint for self-assembly and repair. It defies the second law of thermodynamics by hunting down energy and converting it into a delicate internal order. In doing so, it manufactures causal predictions from patterns in the surrounding randomness. For this creature, uncertainty is rooted in the quality of these predictions. To reduce uncertainty, it has to learn. Unfortunately for our bacterium, to learn means to die. This is because â€œlearningâ€ occurs over tens of thousands of generations. As each organism replicates, mutations cause minute changes of behavior from parent to child. Over evolutionary time scales, natural selection whittles away untold legions, leaving only the fittest few to propagate. Philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett calls such organisms <strong>Darwinian creatures</strong>. <em>â€œThey are born â€œknowingâ€ all they will ever â€œknowâ€; they are gifted but not learners.â€</em> These creatures are unable to adapt within a lifetime because the mechanism with which they extract order from randomness is fixed. Yet, change still happens. Slowly, over the course of aeons, through the life and death of trillions of organisms searching the evolutionary space of possibilities, these tiny beings â€œlearnâ€ and improve their predictions. But this lifestyle has some serious drawbacks. Adaptations require immense time scales, and in some cases that can be too slow. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to die in the process.</p>
