I"O<p>This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of <strong><em>uncertainty</em></strong>, and a practical experiment with the medium we call <strong><em>book</em></strong>. I publish this work-in-progress to share my exploration of this wide topic. But also to solicit feedback from fellow navigators of uncertainty. Once completed, a print version will be published, while this digital garden will remain online. Please drop a comment, poem, drawing, or image on a page you like. These are <strong><em>marginalia</em></strong> in reference to the age-old custom of scribbling in the margins of books. When this book goes to print, select marginalia will be included in the print-run. Authors will be credited by name and receive a <strong><em>free print book</em></strong>.</p>
