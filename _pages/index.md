# Welcome Weary Traveler! ðŸŒ±


Take a stroll through the ***digital garden of uncertainty***. Roam on the curated path and smell the lilies, or wander off into the shadows where the dark roses bloom. But be careful not to stray into the jungle, where creatures howl in the night...

> # About
This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of ***uncertainty***, and a practical experiment with the medium we call ***book***. I publish this work-in-progress to sollicit feedback from fellow travelers of uncertainty. Once it is completed I inted to publish a print version, while this digital garden will stay online.

> # How to read 
This book is an assemblage of aphorisms - each page only a few hunded words long. They are semantically connected, so you can navigate a curated path using the ***forward*** and ***back*** buttons at the bottom of each page. The assemblage has a fractal structure with five main branches. Explore them in any order you like, or use the ***hypergraph*** to view and navigate the entire structure. 

> # Marginalia
Drop a comment, poem, image, or video at the bottom of each page. We call them ***marginalia*** in reference to the custom of scribbling and annotating the margins of books. When this book goes to print, select marginalia will be included in the print-run. Authors will be credited by name and will receive a ***print book free of charge!***
