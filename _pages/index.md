# Welcome Weary Traveler! ðŸŒ±

Take a stroll through the ***digital garden of uncertainty***. Roam on the curated path and smell the lilies, or wander off into the shadows where the dark roses bloom. But be careful not to stray into the jungle, where creatures howl in the night...

<h2 style="color: #f5993d">About</h2>

This book lies at the intersection of two passion projects: my lasting fascination with the existential question of ***uncertainty***, and a practical experiment with the medium we call ***book***. I publish this work-in-progress to sollicit feedback from fellow navigators of uncertainty. Once completed, a print version will be published, while this digital garden will remain online.

<h2 style="color: #f5993d">Marginalia</h2>

Drop a comment, image, or video at the bottom of each page. These contributions are ***marginalia*** in reference to the custom of scribbling and annotating the margins of books. When this book goes to print, select marginalia will be included in the print-run. Authors will be credited by name (if provided) and will receive a ***free print book***

<h2 style="color: #f5993d">How to read this book</h2>

This book has no chapters. It is an assemblage of self-contained paragraphs - each page only a few hunded words long. They are semantically connected, so you can navigate a curated path using the ***next*** and ***back*** buttons at the bottom of each page. This assemblage has a fractal network structure with five main branches: [[origin-story|Introduction]], [[knowledge|Knowledge]], [[agency|Agency]], [[creativity|Creativity]], and [[meaning|Meaning]]. Explore them in any order you like, or use the ***hypergraph*** button to view and navigate the entire structure.
